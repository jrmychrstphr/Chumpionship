new_season.py

1. User input league code
	- I could simplify this to pasting a URL which auto trims to the league code
2. Scrapes from:
	- league standings page (ie, in-season), then
	- new entries page (ie, pre-season)

3. User input for league name (eg, "2024") to be used to name the directory folder

4. Duplicates the contents of the template folder

5. Saves a json witht the league code in it (do I use this?)

6. Saves the scraped data as a json for manual editing before processing further
